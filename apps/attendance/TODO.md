# TODO - Attendance App

## Frontend Refinements

- [ ] Session list: add filter by session_type and date range
- [ ] Session detail: add export attendance list to CSV
- [ ] My history: add statistics summary (total sessions attended, attendance rate percentage)
- [ ] Scanner: add sound/visual feedback on successful scan
- [ ] Scanner: add manual member search (search by name, not just QR code text input)

## Sidebar / Navigation

- [ ] Verify "Mon historique" link is in sidebar for all members
- [ ] Verify "Sessions" and "Scanner QR" links are in admin section of sidebar

## Small Complementary Features

- [ ] Add AbsenceAlert acknowledgment in frontend (model and data exist, but no UI to view/acknowledge alerts)
- [ ] My QR: add QR code download button (save QR image as file)
- [ ] Session detail: add "Close session" button inline (currently only via toggle)
- [ ] Session create: add option to link session to an existing event
- [ ] Add attendance rate chart on member detail page (for admin viewing a member)
- [ ] Scanner page: show member photo on successful scan for visual confirmation
