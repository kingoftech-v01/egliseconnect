# TODO - Help Requests App

## CRUD Completions

- [ ] Category: add frontend CRUD for admin (currently only manageable via Django admin)

## Frontend Refinements

- [ ] Request list: add search bar for filtering by title/description
- [ ] Request detail: add explicit "Close request" button (currently only assign + resolve via `request_update`)
- [ ] My requests: add pagination (currently shows all requests)
- [ ] Request list: add filter by urgency level

## Sidebar / Navigation

- [ ] Verify help request links are visible in sidebar for all roles that can create requests

## Small Complementary Features

- [ ] Add email/notification when request status changes (assigned, resolved, closed)
- [ ] Request detail: show timeline of status changes (created → assigned → resolved)
- [ ] Add request statistics summary on list page (total open, assigned, resolved)
- [ ] My requests: add "New request" button prominently on the page
