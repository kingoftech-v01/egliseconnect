# TODO - Events App

## Frontend Refinements

- [ ] Event list: add search bar for filtering by title
- [ ] Event detail: show full attendee list (currently may be limited)
- [ ] Event detail: add "Cancel event" button for admin/pastor
- [ ] Calendar view: add event type color coding (different colors for different event types)
- [ ] Event form: add validation that end_datetime is after start_datetime

## Sidebar / Navigation

- [ ] Add "Creer" link in sidebar under Evenements for admin/pastors (currently only List + Calendar)

## Small Complementary Features

- [ ] Add recurring event support in frontend (model has `is_recurring` field but no UI to configure recurrence)
- [ ] RSVP: add email/notification when RSVP status changes (confirmed, declined)
- [ ] Event list: add filter by event type
- [ ] Event detail: add "Share event" link (copy link to clipboard)
- [ ] Add past events section on event list (separate upcoming vs past)
