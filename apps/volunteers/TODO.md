# TODO - Volunteers App

## CRUD Completions

- [ ] Swap request: no frontend views at all (only API) — add list + create views for members to request schedule swaps
- [ ] Planned absence: add edit and delete views (currently only list + create)

## Frontend Refinements

- [ ] My schedule: add confirm/decline buttons directly on schedule items
- [ ] Schedule list: add date range filter
- [ ] Position list: show volunteer count per position
- [ ] Planned absence list: add status indicator (pending/approved)
- [ ] Schedule form: add member autocomplete search

## Sidebar / Navigation

- [ ] Verify "Absences planifiees" link is in sidebar under Volontaires section
- [ ] Add "Echanges" link in sidebar when swap request frontend views are implemented

## Small Complementary Features

- [ ] Add notification when a new schedule is assigned to a volunteer
- [ ] Position detail: show current volunteers assigned to the position
- [ ] Add volunteer availability calendar view (visual representation of who's available when)
- [ ] Schedule list: add bulk actions (assign multiple members at once)
